# Custom Connector Testing

When developing Custom Connectors to put data into the Power Platform there are some strategies you can follow:

## Unit Testing

There are several verifications one can do while developing custom connectors in order to be sure the code itself is working properly. There are two main ones: validating the OpenAPI schema which the connector is defined and validating if the schema also have all the information necessary for the certified connector process(the later one is optional, but necessary in case you want to publish it as a certified connector).

For testing if OpenAPI schema is valid, there are several tool available. A list of them are available in this [link](https://openapi.tools/#description-validators). CSE Business Apps teams have been using [swagger-cli](https://github.com/APIDevTools/swagger-cli).

On the other hand, to validate if the custom connector you are building is correct to become a certified connector, use the [paconn-cli](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPlatformConnectors/tree/dev/tools/paconn-cli), since it has a validate command that shows missing information from the custom connector definition.
